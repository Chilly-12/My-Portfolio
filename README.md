# My Portfolio

## About
Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Rafael Timotheus Chili, and I am a student at NUST with a deep passion for coding and creating innovative digital solutions. I recently had the opportunity to attend a pre-WIL employability workshop, where I gained valuable experience working in a team as the project team leader.

Throughout my studies and personal projects, I have developed a wide range of skills, including web development, problem-solving, and collaboration. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tackle new challenges.

## Features
This portfolio website showcases some of my key projects and skills:

1. **Web Development**: The website itself is an example of my web development capabilities, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

2. **Team Leadership**: During the pre-WIL workshop, I had the opportunity to lead a team project, which allowed me to develop my collaboration and leadership skills.

3. **Employability Skills**: The pre-WIL workshop also provided me with insights into the job market and helped me develop a range of employability skills, such as communication, time management, and critical thinking.
